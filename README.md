# medieval-cat-meme-generator

This is a little thing I made for fun and after seeing so many people claim that soon the EU will ban memes. So here's a meme generator that only uses medieval cat images that are in the public domain.

One goal of this project was to build it without a build pipeline, but use the latest JS features. No babel or webpack. Consequently this will probably only work in the latest browsers (chrome, firefox).
All libraries are loaded through CDNs and if possible imported as es6 modules.

Here's everything that was used to build this:
* [https://preactjs.com/](Preact)
* [https://github.com/developit/htm](HTM)
* [https://redux.js.org](Redux)
* [emotion.sh/](Emotion)
* [fabricjs.com/](FabricJS)
* [https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/](Normalize)
